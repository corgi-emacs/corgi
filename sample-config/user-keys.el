;; This is your user keys file, here you can configure key bindings that will
;; get added to Corgi. You can also override Corgi's default bindings this way.
;;
;; Bindings here are nested, e.g. `("SPC" ("b" ("k" kill-buffer)))' means that
;; "space" followed by "b" and then "k" will invoke `M-x kill-buffer'.
;;
;; You can add a descriptions before the command, this will show up in a pop-up
;; when you press the prefix key and wait a bit. (This uses which-key)
;;
;; `("SPC" ("b" ("k" "Choose a buffer to kill" kill-buffer)))'
;;
;; Instead of a prefix key you can use a symbol like `normal' or `insert', which
;; designates the Evil state (what vim calls the mode). `global' means any
;; state, `normal|visual' means either normal or visual.
;;
;; Instead of a command like `kill-buffer' you can put a keyword like
;; `:eval/buffer'. This is called a "signal". In the `corgi-signals' (or
;; `user-signals') file these are bound to specific commands based on the major
;; mode. E.g. in Emacs Lisp `:eval/buffer' means `eval-buffer', whereas in
;; Clojure it means `cider-eval-buffer'.

(bindings
 ;; "global" bindings are always active regardless of Evil's "state" (= vim mode)
 ;; If you don't provide this the default is `normal'.
