Stuff left to do

- the multi-leader-key stuff mostly works, but there's still some weirdness
  around major-mode specific bindings. See the commented hack to prevent
  bindings from one mode bleading into buffers of a different mode.
- prefixes that don't have any assigned bindings in a given mode still show up
  in which key
- extra multi-leader-key into a plexmacs package
- pull the extra commands into a utility package
- see if the CIDER tweaks can (configurably) make it upstream  
- automatically reuse CIDER buffers (should also go upstream?)
- add support for a user config file, so more personal tweaks like the font and
  theme can be split out

Issues
- company mode behaves differently than in spacemacs, making the autocompletion
  a lot less pleasant to work with. Figure out how to fix that
- multi-leader-mode is not enabled by default in *Messages*, possibly because
  the buffer already exists when it gets loaded
- smartparens/evil-cleverparens are currently only enabled in Clojure and Emacs
  Lisp buffers, which is annoying e.g. when navigating Java (I keep trying to
  copy identifiers with ~yL~, but ~L~ navigates to end of buffer instead of to
  next form). Should this be enabled in all ~prog-mode~ buffers?

Stuff still worth considering adding
- auto-highlight-symbol -> main thing I use this for in spacemacs is navigating
  with # and *
- org-mode -> kind of obvious
  - make sure eval of clojure code blocks works
- magit -> I don't really use it much, but just improved commit message buffer
  bindings would be great, and if this is going to be a proper "distro" it
  should be in there.
- JS/python -> I don't want support for every language, but these two are so
  dominant they should be supported out of the box
- HTML/CSS -> the web, yo!
- Markdown mode -> make sure code block handling works properly

With the above things added we're not *that* lightweight anymore, so spend some
time tweaking the use-package declarations so more things are loaded on demand.

More far fetched ideas
- Start a babashka nrepl instance on startup, and have ~*scratch*~ start in
  clojure-mode, with eval going to babashka, so it's always possible to eval
  clojure forms.
- When trying to eval in a clojure buffer that does not have a connection,
  instead of silently doing nothing, give the user options
  - jack-in
  - sesman-link the buffer to the babashka connection
  - sesman-link to another existing connection
  - cider-connect

https://github.com/kommen/lesser-evil/commits/main

- evil-escape (fd)
- magit / evil-magit -> fix TAB
- desktop-save-mode causes pain (saves theme information?)
- theme -> likes dracula or eigengrau (jack's theme)
- navigating auto complete buffers down with CTRL-j
